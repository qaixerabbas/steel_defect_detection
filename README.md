# steel_defect_detection
A FastAI ResNet-18 implemented and trained on Steel Defect Database by NEU
The Datasets is from Kechen Song, Northeastern University (NEU). You can visit their Homepage http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/me/songkc/Vision-based_SIS_Steel.html to download 1800 images.

FasAI is very powerfull and easy to use library built on top of PyTorch. I have trained a ResNet-18 on this database. The results and further information about code is in the notebook and the database and further information about it, can be donwloaded from the link provided.
